**This C++ code implements a basic lexical analyzer, which is a fundamental part of a compiler or interpreter. Its primary function is to process a source code string and break it down into smaller, meaningful components called tokens. The program recognizes four types of tokens: keywords, identifiers, numbers, and symbols. Keywords are reserved words in the programming language (e.g., int, return), identifiers are user-defined names (e.g., variable names like x), numbers represent numeric values (e.g., 10), and symbols are special characters (e.g., =, ;). The program processes the input character by character, grouping them into tokens, classifying each based on predefined rules, and then printing the resulting tokens along with their types. This lexical analyzer is particularly useful in the context of compiler design, as it performs the first phase of compiling code. It's also valuable in custom programming languages, syntax highlighters for integrated development environments (IDEs), static code analysis tools, and interpreters. However, it has limitations, such as the lack of support for string literals, comments, and error handling, which can be addressed by extending the program. **
